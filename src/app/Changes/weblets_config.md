A new console command [`BuildWeblets`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Femili%2FDesktop%2Fadding_weblets_config.txt%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A38%7D%7D%5D%2C%2263133014-ae57-437b-90d7-3e859172e42d%22%5D "Go to definition") has been added to the Laravel application. This command is defined in the file 

BuildWeblets.php

.

**File: 

BuildWeblets.php

**
```php
<?php

namespace App\Console\Commands;

use Illuminate\Console\Command;

class BuildWeblets extends Command
{
    /**
     * The name and signature of the console command.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $signature = 'build-weblets';

    /**
     * The console command description.
     *
     * @var string
     */
    protected $description = 'Command description';

    /**
     * Execute the console command.
     */
    public function handle()
    {
        $this->info('Building weblets...');
        $weblets = json_encode($this->getWeblets(), JSON_PRETTY_PRINT | JSON_UNESCAPED_SLASHES | JSON_UNESCAPED_UNICODE);
        $this->info($weblets);
    }

    private function getWeblets() : array
    {
        return require config_path('weblets.php');
    }
}
```

**Key Points:**

- **Class Definition:** The class [`BuildWeblets`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Femili%2FDesktop%2Fadding_weblets_config.txt%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A0%2C%22character%22%3A38%7D%7D%5D%2C%2263133014-ae57-437b-90d7-3e859172e42d%22%5D "Go to definition") extends [`Command`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Femili%2FDesktop%2Fadding_weblets_config.txt%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A10%2C%22character%22%3A24%7D%7D%5D%2C%2263133014-ae57-437b-90d7-3e859172e42d%22%5D "Go to definition").
- **Signature and Description:** The command is registered with the signature `build-weblets` and has a placeholder description.
- **Handle Method:** The [`handle`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Femili%2FDesktop%2Fadding_weblets_config.txt%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A31%2C%22character%22%3A21%7D%7D%5D%2C%2263133014-ae57-437b-90d7-3e859172e42d%22%5D "Go to definition") method outputs a message, retrieves the weblets configuration, encodes it to JSON, and outputs the JSON.
- **getWeblets Method:** This private method loads the weblets configuration from 

weblets.php

.

#### 2. **Deletion of `gapplets.php` Configuration File**

The configuration file `src/config/gapplets.php` has been deleted.

**File: `src/config/gapplets.php`**
```php
<?php

return [
    'mtq' => [
        'title' => 'Mythic Treasure Quest',
        'root' => 'MtqGame',
        'MtqGame' => [
            'states' => [
                'Initial',
                'Playing',
                'Flagging',
                'GameOver',
            ],
        ],
        'MtqMap' => [
            'states' => [
                'Initial'
            ],
        ],
        'MtqInventory' => [
            'states' => [
                'Initial'
            ],
        ],
        'MtqTile' => [
            'states' => [
                'Initial'
            ],
        ],
        'MtqItem' => [
            'states' => [
                'Initial'
            ],
        ],
    ]
];
```

**Key Points:**
- The entire file defining the [`gapplets`](command:_github.copilot.openSymbolFromReferences?%5B%22%22%2C%5B%7B%22uri%22%3A%7B%22scheme%22%3A%22file%22%2C%22authority%22%3A%22%22%2C%22path%22%3A%22%2FC%3A%2FUsers%2Femili%2FDesktop%2Fadding_weblets_config.txt%22%2C%22query%22%3A%22%22%2C%22fragment%22%3A%22%22%7D%2C%22pos%22%3A%7B%22line%22%3A43%2C%22character%22%3A24%7D%7D%5D%2C%2263133014-ae57-437b-90d7-3e859172e42d%22%5D "Go to definition") configuration has been removed.

#### 3. **Addition of 

weblets.php

 Configuration File**

weblets.php

 has been added. This file defines the configuration for two games: "La Búsqueda del Tesoro Mítico" (mtq) and "Guess The Number" (gtn).

**File: 

weblets.php

**
```php

                'flagging-tile' => [],
                'gameOver-tile' => [],
                'hidden' => ['marked_as_clue', 'marked_as_flag'],
                'revealed' => ['has_trap', 'traps_around'],
            ],

            'marked_as_flag' => ['boolean'],
        ],
        'item' => [
            'states' => [
                'item-normal-state'
            ],
            'slug' => ['string'],
            'icon' => ['string'],
            'name' => ['string'],
            'quantity' => ['integer'],
        ],
    ],

    'gtn' => [
        'title' => 'Guess The Number',
        'root' => 'game',

        'game' => [
            'states' => [
                'asking-to-play' => [],

                'success' => [],
            ],
        ],
